# One thing to remember is need to complete what I have done before:

Literature review (four parts) 

Method Descriptions and more precise results  

And within 2 weeks, I need to finish R graphics for the class on Oct.14 and web scraping something. 

And Oct must submit this paper

+ the timeline is go thtough all the policy -- summarize the context -- revise the algorithms -- results-- graphics enhance   

-- words and grammars -- check -- end 


## Some good websites today 

https://www.r-bloggers.com/lang/chinese/1224  -- 12 recommended books on R  

And I borrow one named "Graphics for statistics and data analysis with R"ï¼Œ but it turned out to be not that good  

The pictures displayed in this book, how do i say, is sooooo ugly, and I lost the interest in less than 5 second.   

Then I opened R in action, I will put some of the words in the python beginning practice folder.
